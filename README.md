# Disease Detection in Finger Millet (Ragi) Plant Using VGG19

## Overview
Finger millet (locally known as **Ragi**) is a vital crop for millions due to its nutritional and ecological benefits. However, diseases affecting finger millet can drastically reduce yield and threaten food security. This project focuses on developing a **disease detection system** using **VGG19**, a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to assist farmers and researchers in identifying diseases early and accurately.

---

## Features
- **State-of-the-Art CNN**: Leveraging the power of **VGG16** with transfer learning to classify diseases in finger millet plants.
- **High Accuracy**: Tailored fine-tuning and data augmentation strategies ensure precise disease detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for real-time disease diagnosis.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to be extensible for other crops and regions.

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of high-quality images of finger millet plants captured under various conditions. The dataset is preprocessed with techniques such as:
- **Image Resizing**: Standardized to the input size of 224x224 for VGG19.
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments to simulate diverse field conditions and reduce overfitting.

---

## Methodology
### 1. **Model Architecture**
The VGG19 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, serves as the base model. Key steps include:
- Removing the top classification layer.
- Adding custom dense layers with **Global Average Pooling**.
- Incorporating **Batch Normalization** and **Dropout** to prevent overfitting.

### 2. **Transfer Learning**
The pre-trained weights of VGG19 are fine-tuned to specialize in recognizing diseases in finger millet plants.

### 3. **Training Process**
- Optimizer: **Adam** with a learning rate of 0.0001.
- Loss Function: **Categorical Crossentropy** for multi-class classification.
- Metrics: Accuracy.

### 4. **Evaluation**
The model was evaluated on a validation set with metrics such as:
- Accuracy

---

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved **86.7%** accuracy on the validation set.
- **Insights**: DenseNet performed better in earlier trials, but VGG16 showed comparable results with lower computational requirements.
